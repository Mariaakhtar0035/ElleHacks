## Overview

In Canada, 64% of people say they never learned financial literacy in school, and 84% believe learning it earlier would have reduced their financial stress.

Starting September 2026, students will be required to meet a new financial literacy graduation requirement in their Grade 10 math course. While financial literacy is becoming more common in classrooms, traditional lessons often do not stick.

**Finity changes that by letting students learn by doing.**

Through a classroom economy, students experience real-world money concepts like supply and demand, saving toward goals, and compound growth before the stakes are real. Instead of memorizing terms, they build habits and confidence through hands-on decisions.

Finity turns financial literacy from a one-time lesson into a daily experience, helping students build valuable financial skills that reduce future stress and support smarter money decisions for life.
